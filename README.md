To copy the hex code of a colour, simply click on the copy button. The hex code will be copied to your clipboard.

## Code explanation

The code for the colour generator is written in JavaScript and HTML and styled with CSS. The JavaScript code is responsible for generating the colours, locking the colours, and copying the hex codes to the clipboard. The HTML code is responsible for displaying the colours and the user interface.

### JavaScript code

The JavaScript code is organized into a single class called `Colour`. This class has a constructor that takes three arguments: the hex code of the colour, the HTML element that represents the colour, and a boolean value that indicates whether the colour is locked.

The `Colour` class has several methods:

* `setHex(hex)`: This method sets the hex code of the colour and updates the background colour of the HTML element.
* `setLocked(locked)`: This method sets the locked property of the colour and updates the appearance of the HTML element.
* `toggleLocked()`: This method toggles the locked property of the colour.
* `generateHex()`: This method generates a random hex code and sets the hex code of the colour.
* `copyToClipboard()`: This method copies the hex code of the colour to the clipboard.

### HTML code

The HTML code for the colour generator consists of a grid of four coloured squares. Each square has a colour input field, a lock toggle, and a copy button.

The colour input field is used to enter the hex code of a colour. The lock toggle is used to lock the colour. The copy button is used to copy the hex code of the colour to the clipboard.

## Conclusion

The colour generator is a simple but useful tool that can be used
